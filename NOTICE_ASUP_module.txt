behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the

Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on

electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems

that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing

and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked

or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a

Contribution."



"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of

whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated

within the Work.



2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this

License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,

non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to

reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,

sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object

form.



3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,

each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,

no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent

license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise

transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims

licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to

which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation

against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)

alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes

direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to

You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such

litigation is filed.



4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in

Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:



  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of

    this License; and



  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that

    You changed the files; and



  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You

    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from

    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to

    any part of the Derivative Works; and



  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then

    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those

    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least

    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of

    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the

    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do

    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within

    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the

    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices

    cannot be construed as modifying the License.



You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide

additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or

distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,

provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

with the conditions stated in this License.



5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any

Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have

executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,

trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required

for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.



7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its

Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,

either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or

conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in

writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or

losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such

damages.



9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or

rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You

may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of

any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each

Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,

such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional

liability.

GNU Lesser General Public License

=================================



Version 2.1, February 1999



      Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.



      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies



      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



      [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts



      as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence



      the version number 2.1.]





Preamble

--------



The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share

and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to

guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the

software is free for all its users.



This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially

designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software

Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we

suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary

General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,

based on the explanations below.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom

to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change

the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed

that you can do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to

deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

library or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code

with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so

that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library

and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.



We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and

(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,

distribute and/or modify the library.



To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no

warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else

and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original

version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by

problems that might be introduced by others.



Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free

program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the

users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.

Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the

library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this

license.



Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU

General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,

applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary

General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to

permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.



When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared

library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a

derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore

permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.

The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other

code with the library.



We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to

protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also

provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing

non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General

Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides

advantages in certain special circumstances.



For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the

widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.

To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more

frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free

libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to

free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.



In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs

enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For

example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many

more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the

GNU/Linux operating system.



Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'

freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the

Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified

version of the Library.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the

library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived

from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order

to run.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

---------------------------------------------------------------



0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which

contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying

it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also

called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".



A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as

to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those

functions and data) to form executables.



The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been

distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the

Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work

containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications

and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,

translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)



"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source

code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,

plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.



Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by

this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the

Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its

contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the

Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the

Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.



1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source

code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer

of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the

absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the

Library.



You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at

your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus

forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications

or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of

these conditions:



      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.



      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating

      that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all

      third parties under the terms of this License.



      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of

      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other

      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make

      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not

      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs

      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.



      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose

      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,

      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used

      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,

      the square root function must still compute square roots.)



      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be

      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then

      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you

      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same

      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the

      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose

      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to

      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your

      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise

      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works

      based on the Library.



      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with

      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage

      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of

      this License.



3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License

instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must

alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the

ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a

newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has

appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any

other change in these notices.



Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so

the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and

derivative works made from that copy.



This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into

a program that is not a library.



4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,

under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1

and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding

machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of

Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.



If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a

designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from

the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even

though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object

code.



5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is

designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called

a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative

work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.



However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an

executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of

the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is

therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of

such executables.



When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part

of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the

Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially

significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is

itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by

law.



If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and

accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in

length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether

it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus

portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)



Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the

object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing

that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with

the Library itself.



6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work

that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of

the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that

the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse

engineering for debugging such modifications.



You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is

used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must

supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright

notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as

well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you

must do one of these things:



      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable

      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the

      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the

      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete

      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source

      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a

      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that

      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will

      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified

      definitions.)



      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A

      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library

      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library

      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a

      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the

      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was

      made with.



      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,

      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for

      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.



      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a

      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified

      materials from the same place.



      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or

      that you have already sent this user a copy.



For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must

include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from

it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not

include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)

with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system

on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the

executable.



It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other

proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a

contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an

executable that you distribute.



7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library

side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not

covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that

the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other

library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two

things:



      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the

      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be

      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.



      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of

      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the

      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.



8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library

except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,

modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have

received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their

licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library

or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept

this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work

based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library

or works based on it.



10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),

the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to

copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and

conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'

exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing

compliance by third parties with this License.



11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement

or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on

you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the

conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this

License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your

obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a

consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those

who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you

could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from

distribution of the Library.



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the

section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or

other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this

section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software

distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people

have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is

up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software

through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

consequence of the rest of this License.



12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain

countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright

holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical

distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is

permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this

License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.



13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be

similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

problems or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a

version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you

have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or

of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library

does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever

published by the Free Software Foundation.



14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs

whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to

ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software

Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions

for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free

status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and

reuse of software generally.



NO WARRANTY



15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE

LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED

IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"

WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE

LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,

SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY

TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF

THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER

PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.





END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

----------------------------------------------



If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can

redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these

terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public

License).



To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest

to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the

exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line

and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.



      Copyright (C) year name of author



      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or



      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public



      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either



      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,



      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of



      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU



      Lesser General Public License for more details.



      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public



      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software



      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a

sample; alter the names:



      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in



      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written



      by James Random Hacker.



      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990



      Ty Coon, President of Vice



That's all there is to it!

2. License Grants and Conditions

--------------------------------





  2.1. Grants



  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive

  license:



    a.



      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,

      display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,

      either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger

      Work; and



    b.



      under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,

      have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its

      Contributor Version.





  2.2. Effective Date



  The licenses granted in Section2.1 with respect to any Contribution become

  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes

  such Contribution.





  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope



  The licenses granted in this Section2 are the only rights granted under this

  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution

  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding

  Section2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:



    a.



      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or



    b.



      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's

      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

      Version); or



    c.



      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its

      Contributions.



  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or

  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice

  requirements in Section3.4).





  2.4. Subsequent Licenses



  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute

  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see

  Section10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the

  terms of Section3.3).





  2.5. Representation



  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are

  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its

  Contributions conveyed by this License.





  2.6. Fair Use



  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable

  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.





  2.7. Conditions



  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in

  Section2.1.





3. Responsibilities

-------------------





  3.1. Distribution of Source Form



  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the

  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of

  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can

  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the

  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.





  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form



  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:



    a.



      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as

      described in Section3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable

      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable

      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution

      to the recipient; and



    b.



      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or

      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the

      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights

      in the Source Code Form under this License.





  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work



  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the

  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with

  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is

  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to

  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary

  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,

  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License

  or such Secondary License(s).





  3.4. Notices



  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including

  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of

  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,

  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy

  known factual inaccuracies.





  3.5. Application of Additional Terms



  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity

  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.

  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any

  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,

  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby

  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such

  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You

  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of

  liability specific to any jurisdiction.





4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

---------------------------------------------------



If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with

respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or

regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the

maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they

affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all

distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent

prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently

detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.





5. Termination

--------------



  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You

  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then

  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are

  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and

  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such

  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means

  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your

  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such

  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this

  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License

  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your

  receipt of the notice.



  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and

  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly

  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all

  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section2.1 of this License shall

  terminate.



  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user

  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been

  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to

  termination shall survive termination.





6. Disclaimer of Warranty

-------------------------



Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without

warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without

limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,

merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as

to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any

Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume

the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of

warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered

Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.





7. Limitation of Liability

--------------------------



Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including

negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who

distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,

indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work

stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial

damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility

of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for

death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent

applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the

exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion

and limitation may not apply to You.





8. Litigation

-------------



Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a

jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and

such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference

to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a

party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.





9. Miscellaneous

----------------



This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter

hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be

construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against

a Contributor.





10. Versions of the License

---------------------------





  10.1. New Versions



  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section10.3,

  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new

  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version

  number.





  10.2. Effect of New Versions



  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the

  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the

  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.





  10.3. Modified Versions



  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a

  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of

  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of

  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from

  this License).





  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

  Licenses



  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice

  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.





Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

-------------------------------------------



  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,

  v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can

  obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.



If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then

You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant

directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.



You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.





Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

---------------------------------------------------------



  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined

  by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
