Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:



  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of

    this License; and



  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that

    You changed the files; and



  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You

    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from

    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to

    any part of the Derivative Works; and



  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then

    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those

    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least

    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of

    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the

    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do

    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within

    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the

    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices

    cannot be construed as modifying the License.



You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide

additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or

distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,

provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

with the conditions stated in this License.



5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any

Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have

executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,

trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required

for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.



7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its

Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,

either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or

conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in

writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or

losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such

damages.



9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or

rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You

may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of

any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each

Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,

such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional

liability.

GNU General Public License v3.0 only

(yggdrasil-worker-package-manager 0.2.2)

"This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under

the terms of version 3 of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free

Software Foundation."







GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

==========================



Version 3,29 June 2007



Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.





Preamble



The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other

kinds of works.



The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take

away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General

Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all

versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of

our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.

You can apply it to your programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you

receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the

software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do

these things.



To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights

or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain

responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:

responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You

must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must

show them these terms so they know their rights.



Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert

copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal

permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.



For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there

is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL

requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will

not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.



Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified

versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This

is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change

the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products

for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.

Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for

those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand

ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as

needed to protect the freedom of users.



Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States

should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on

general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special

danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively

proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to

render the program non-free.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS



0. Definitions.



This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.



Copyright also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,

such as semiconductor masks.



The Program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each

licensee is addressed as you. Licensees and recipients may be individuals

or organizations.



To modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a

fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.

The resulting work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work

based on the earlier work.



A covered work means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the

Program.



To propagate a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,

would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable

copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.

Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making

available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.



To convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to

make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,

with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.



An interactive user interface displays Appropriate Legal Notices to the extent

that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays

an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty

for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees

may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a

prominent item in the list meets this criterion.



1. Source Code.



The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. Object code means any non-source form of a work.



A Standard Interface means an interface that either is an official standard

defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified

for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers

working in that language.



The System Libraries of an executable work include anything, other than the

work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major

Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to

enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard

Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code

form. A Major Component, in this context, means a major essential component

(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on

which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an

object code interpreter used to run it.



The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form means all the source

code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object

code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose

tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in

performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,

Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source

files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically

linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by

intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other

parts of the work.



The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate

automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.



The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.



2. Basic Permissions.



All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on

the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This

License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified

Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only

if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License

acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by

copyright law.



You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without

conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey

covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications

exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,

provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material

for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered

works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and

control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted

material outside their relationship with you.



Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions

stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.



3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.



No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under

any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright

treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting

circumvention of such measures.



When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention

of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by

exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you

disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means

of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to

forbid circumvention of technological measures.



4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.



You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in

any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each

copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this

License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the

code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all

recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.



You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may

offer support or warranty protection for a fee.



5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.



You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it

from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,

provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



  * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and

    giving a relevant date.



  * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under

    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement

    modifies the requirement in section 4 to keep intact all notices.



  * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone

    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along

    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and

    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no

    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate

    such permission if you have separately received it.



  * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate

    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not

    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.



A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which

are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not

combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage

or distribution medium, is called an aggregate if the compilation and its

resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the

compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a

covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other

parts of the aggregate.



6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.



You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4

and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source

under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:



  * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed

    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.



  * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at

    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer

    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code

    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the

    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium

    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your

    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)

    access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.



  * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written

    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only

    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code

    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.



  * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis

    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in

    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not

    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object

    code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the

    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third

    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain

    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the

    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding

    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as

    needed to satisfy these requirements.



  * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you

    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work

    are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.



A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the

Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the

object code work.



A User Product is either (1) a consumer product, which means any tangible

personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household

purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In

determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be

resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular

user, normally used refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,

regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the

particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A

product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial

commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only

significant mode of use of the product.



Installation Information for a User Product means any methods, procedures,

authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified

versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its

Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued

functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered

with solely because modification has been made.



If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically

for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in

which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the

recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is

characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be

accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply

if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object

code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).



The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a

requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a

work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User

Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be

denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the

operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication

across the network.



Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord

with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an

implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no

special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.



7. Additional Terms.



Additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this License by

making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that

are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were

included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.

If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be

used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed

by this License without regard to the additional permissions.



When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any

additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional

permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you

modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you

to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright

permission.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a

covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)

supplement the terms of this License with terms:



  * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of

    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or



  * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author

    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed

    by works containing it; or



  * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring

    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as

    different from the original version; or



  * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors

    of the material; or



  * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,

    trademarks, or service marks; or



  * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by

    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual

    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these

    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.



All other non-permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions

within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part

of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a

term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license

document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying

under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms

of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive

such relicensing or conveying.



If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,

in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to

those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.



Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a

separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply

either way.



8. Termination.



You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under

this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent

licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).



However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a

particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the

copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)

permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some

reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.



Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated

permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some

reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of

this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the

violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.



Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of

parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your

rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to

receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.



9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.



You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of

the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a

consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does

not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you

permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe

copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or

propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do

so.



10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.



Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a

license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,

subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by

third parties with this License.



An entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an organization,

or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging

organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity

transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also

receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or

could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the

Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the

predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.



You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted

or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,

royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and

you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a

lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,

offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.



11. Patents.



A contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of

the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is

called the contributor's contributor version.



A contributor's essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or

controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,

that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,

using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would

be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor

version. For purposes of this definition, control includes the right to grant

patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.



Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent

license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,

offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of

its contributor version.



In the following three paragraphs, a patent license is any express agreement or

commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express

permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).

To grant such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or

commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.



If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the

Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of

charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network

server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the

Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of

the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a

manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent

license to downstream recipients. Knowingly relying means you have actual

knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a

country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe

one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe

are valid.



If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you

convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a

patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them

to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the

patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the

covered work and works based on it.



A patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of

its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of

one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You

may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third

party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make

payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the

work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would

receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in

connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from

those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or

compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that

arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.



Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied

license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you

under applicable patent law.



12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.



If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)

that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the

conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy

simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent

obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if

you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying

from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both

those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the

Program.



13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link

or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU

Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the

resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part

which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General

Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply

to the combination as such.



14. Revised Versions of this License.



The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU

General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in

spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems

or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies

that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License or any later

version applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions

either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free

Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU

General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free

Software Foundation.



If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU

General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance

of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.



Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,

no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a

result of your choosing to follow a later version.



15. Disclaimer of Warranty.



THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER

PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE

QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE

DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. Limitation of Liability.



IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY

COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS

PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,

INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE

THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED

INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE

PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY

HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.



If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot

be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall

apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil

liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of

liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.



END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it

does.>

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or

    (at your option) any later version.



    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    GNU General Public License for more details.



    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this

when it starts in an interactive mode:



    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be

different; for a GUI interface, you would use an about box.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if

any, to sign a copyright disclaimer for the program, if necessary. For more

information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of

this License. But first, please read

<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
