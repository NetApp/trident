no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent

license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise

transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims

licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to

which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation

against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)

alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes

direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to

You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such

litigation is filed.



4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in

Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:



  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of

    this License; and



  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that

    You changed the files; and



  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You

    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from

    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to

    any part of the Derivative Works; and



  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then

    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those

    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least

    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of

    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the

    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do

    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within

    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the

    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices

    cannot be construed as modifying the License.



You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide

additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or

distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,

provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

with the conditions stated in this License.



5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any

Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have

executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,

trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required

for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.



7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its

Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,

either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or

conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in

writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or

losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such

damages.



9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or

rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You

may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of

any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each

Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,

such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional

liability.

2. License Grants and Conditions

--------------------------------





  2.1. Grants



  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive

  license:



    a.



      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,

      display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,

      either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger

      Work; and



    b.



      under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,

      have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its

      Contributor Version.





  2.2. Effective Date



  The licenses granted in Section2.1 with respect to any Contribution become

  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes

  such Contribution.





  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope



  The licenses granted in this Section2 are the only rights granted under this

  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution

  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding

  Section2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:



    a.



      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or



    b.



      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's

      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

      Version); or



    c.



      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its

      Contributions.



  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or

  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice

  requirements in Section3.4).





  2.4. Subsequent Licenses



  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute

  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see

  Section10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the

  terms of Section3.3).





  2.5. Representation



  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are

  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its

  Contributions conveyed by this License.





  2.6. Fair Use



  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable

  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.





  2.7. Conditions



  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in

  Section2.1.





3. Responsibilities

-------------------





  3.1. Distribution of Source Form



  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the

  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of

  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can

  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the

  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.





  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form



  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:



    a.



      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as

      described in Section3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable

      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable

      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution

      to the recipient; and



    b.



      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or

      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the

      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights

      in the Source Code Form under this License.





  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work



  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the

  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with

  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is

  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to

  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary

  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,

  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License

  or such Secondary License(s).





  3.4. Notices



  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including

  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of

  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,

  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy

  known factual inaccuracies.





  3.5. Application of Additional Terms



  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity

  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.

  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any

  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,

  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby

  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such

  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You

  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of

  liability specific to any jurisdiction.





4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

---------------------------------------------------



If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with

respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or

regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the

maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they

affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all

distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent

prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently

detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.





5. Termination

--------------



  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You

  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then

  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are

  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and

  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such

  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means

  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your

  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such

  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this

  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License

  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your

  receipt of the notice.



  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and

  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly

  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all

  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section2.1 of this License shall

  terminate.



  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user

  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been

  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to

  termination shall survive termination.





6. Disclaimer of Warranty

-------------------------



Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without

warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without

limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,

merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as

to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any

Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume

the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of

warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered

Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.





7. Limitation of Liability

--------------------------



Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including

negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who

distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,

indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work

stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial

damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility

of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for

death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent

applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the

exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion

and limitation may not apply to You.





8. Litigation

-------------



Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a

jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and

such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference

to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a

party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.





9. Miscellaneous

----------------



This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter

hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be

construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against

a Contributor.





10. Versions of the License

---------------------------





  10.1. New Versions



  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section10.3,

  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new

  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version

  number.





  10.2. Effect of New Versions



  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the

  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the

  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.





  10.3. Modified Versions



  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a

  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of

  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of

  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from

  this License).





  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

  Licenses



  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice

  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.





Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

-------------------------------------------



  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,

  v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can

  obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.



If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then

You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant

directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.



You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.





Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

---------------------------------------------------------



  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined

  by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
