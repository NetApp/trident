What is Trident?
################

Trident is a fully supported `open source project`_ maintained by `NetApp`_. It
has been designed from the ground up to help you meet your containerized
applications' persistence demands using industry-standard interfaces, such as the
`Container Storage Interface (CSI)`_.

Trident deploys in Kubernetes clusters as pods and provides dynamic storage
orchestration services for your Kubernetes workloads. It enables your
containerized applications to quickly and easily consume persistent storage from
NetApp’s broad portfolio that includes `ONTAP`_ (AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud/Amazon FSx for ONTAP), `Element Software`_
(NetApp HCI/SolidFire), as
well as the `Azure NetApp Files`_ service, `Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud`_,
and the `Cloud Volumes Service on AWS`_.

Trident is also a foundational technology for NetApp's `Astra`_, which addresses
your data protection, disaster recovery, portability, and migration use cases
for Kubernetes workloads leveraging NetApp's industry-leading data management
technology for snapshots, backups, replication, and cloning.

Take a look at the `Astra documentation`_ to get started today.
See `NetApp's Support site`_ for details on Trident's support policy under the
`Trident's Release and Support Lifecycle`_ tab.
