 ONTAP Error Response Codes
| Error Code | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |

| 918236 | The specified `location.volume.uuid` and `location.volume.name` do not refer to the same volume. |
| 2621462 | The specified SVM does not exist. |
| 2621706 | The specified `svm.uuid` and `svm.name` do not refer to the same SVM. |
| 2621707 | No SVM was specified. Either `svm.name` or `svm.uuid` must be supplied. |
| 5242927 | The specified qtree was not found. |
| 5242950 | The specified `location.qtree.id` and `location.qtree.name` do not refer to the same qtree. |
| 5374121 | A LUN name can only contain characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-", ".", "_", "{" and "}". |
| 5374123 | A negative size was provided for the LUN. |
| 5374124 | The specified size is too small for the LUN. |
| 5374125 | The specified size is too large for the LUN. |
| 5374129 | LUNs cannot be created on a load sharing mirror volume. |
| 5374130 | An invalid size value was provided. |
| 5374237 | LUNs cannot be created on an SVM root volume. |
| 5374238 | LUNs cannot be created in Snapshot copies. |
| 5374241 | A size value with invalid units was provided. |
| 5374242 | A LUN or NVMe namespace already exists at the specified path. |
| 5374352 | An invalid name was provided for the LUN. |
| 5374707 | Creating a LUN in the specific volume is not allowed because the volume is reserved for an application. |
| 5374858 | The volume specified by `name` is not the same as that specified by `location.volume`. |
| 5374859 | No volume was specified for the LUN. |

| 5374883 | The property cannot be specified when creating a LUN clone. The `target` property of the error object identifies the property. |
| 5374884 | A property that is required when creating a new LUN that is not a LUN clone or LUN copy was not supplied. The `target` property of the error object identifies the property. |
| 5374886 | An error occurred after successfully creating the LUN preventing the retrieval of its properties. |
| 5374899 | The `clone.source.uuid` property is not supported when specifying a source LUN from a Snapshot copy. |
| 5374928 | An incomplete attribute name/value pair was supplied. |
| 5374929 | The combined sizes of an attribute name and value are too large. |
| 5374932 | A name for an attribute was duplicated. |
| 5374942 | The property cannot be specified at the same time when creating a LUN as a clone. The `target` property of the error object identifies the other property given with clone. |
| 5374943 | The property cannot be specified at the same time when creating a LUN as a copy. The `target` property of the error object identifies the other property given with copy. |
| 5374944 | The property cannot be specified when converting an NVMe namespace into a LUN. The `target` property of the error object identifies the property. |
