Trident is a fully supported open source project maintained by [NetApp](https://www.netapp.com). It has been designed
from the ground up to help you meet your containerized applications' persistence demands using industry-standard
interfaces, such as the [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/introduction.html).

Trident deploys in Kubernetes clusters as pods and provides dynamic storage orchestration services for your Kubernetes workloads. It enables your containerized applications to quickly and easily consume persistent storage from NetAppâ€™s broad portfolio that
includes [ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/data-management/ontap-data-management-software) (AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud), [Element](https://www.netapp.com/data-management/element-software) (HCI/SolidFire), as well as the [Azure NetApp Files](https://cloud.netapp.com/azure-netapp-files)
service, [Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud](https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-gcp), and [Amazon FSx for ONTAP](https://cloud.netapp.com/fsx-for-ontap).

Trident features also address data protection, disaster recovery, portability, and migration use cases for 
Kubernetes workloads leveraging NetApp's industry-leading data management technology for snapshots, backups, 
replication, and cloning.

Detailed documentation for Trident can be found [here](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/index.html).
