## Changes since v24.06.0

**New:** Trident data protection and data management features
- Backup and recovery
- Disaster recovery
- Application mobility
- Data migration

You are required to install the new Trident protect module to unlock these capabilities. [Read more to get started](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/learn-about-trident-protect.html).

**Fixes:**

- Added support for Windows Server 2019.
- **Kubernetes:** Fixed Rancher admission webhook preventing Trident Helm installations (Issue [#839](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/839)).
- **Kubernetes:** Fixed Affinity key in Helm chart values (Issue [#898](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/898)).
- **Kubernetes:** Fixed tridentControllerPluginNodeSelector/tridentNodePluginNodeSelector won't work with "true"
  value (Issue [#899](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/899)).
- **Kubernetes:** Delete ephemeral snapshots created during cloning (Issue [#901](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/901)).
- Fixed `go mod tidy` in Trident repo (Issue [#767](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/767)).

**Enhancements:**

- **Kubernetes:** Added support for Kubernetes 1.31.
- **Kubernetes:** Added new flag `--k8s_api_qps` to installers to set the QPS value used by Trident to communicate 
  with the Kubernetes API server.
- **Kubernetes:** Added `--node-prep` flag to installers for automatic management of storage protocol dependencies 
  on Kubernetes cluster nodes. Tested and verified compatibility with Amazon Linux 2023 iSCSI storage protocol.
- **Kubernetes:** Added support for force detach for ONTAP-NAS-Economy NFS volumes during Non-Graceful Node Shutdown 
  scenarios.
- **Kubernetes:** New ONTAP-NAS-Economy NFS volumes will use per-qtree export policies when using `autoExportPolicy` 
  backend option. Qtrees will only be mapped to node restrictive export policies at time of publish to improve 
  access control and security. Existing qtrees will be switched to the new export policy model when Trident 
  unpublishes the volume from all nodes to do so without impacting active workloads. 
- Google Cloud NetApp Volumes driver is now generally available for NFS volumes and supports zone-aware provisioning.
- GCP Workload Identity will be used as Cloud Identity for Google Cloud NetApp Volumes with GKE.
- Added `formatOptions` configuration parameter to ONTAP-SAN and ONTAP-SAN-Economy drivers to allow users to specify LUN format options.
- Reduced Azure NetApp Files minimum volume size to 50 GiB. Azure new minimum size expected to GA in November.
- Added `denyNewVolumePools` configuration parameter to restrict ONTAP-NAS-Economy and ONTAP-SAN-Economy drivers to 
  preexisting Flexvol pools.
- Added detection for the addition or removal of aggregates from the SVM across all ONTAP drivers.
- Added 18 MiB overhead for iSCSI LUKS LUNs to ensure reported PVC size is usable.
- Improved node stage and unstage error handling for iSCSI ONTAP-SAN and ONTAP-SAN-Economy to allow unstage to remove devices.
- Added a custom role generator allowing customers to create a minimalistic role for Trident in ONTAP.
- Added additional logging for troubleshooting `lsscsi` (Issue [#792](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/792)).

**Deprecations:**

## v21.07.0

- **IMPORTANT**: Trident has updated its recommendations for the iSCSI setup on worker nodes. Please carefully read the `Preparing the worker node` section of the documentation. Please ensure worker node multipathing configuration uses
  the `find_multipaths` value set to `no`.

- **IMPORTANT**: In Trident versions earlier than 21.07, you could create ANF backend with no valid Capacity Pools corresponding to a Service Level. As a result the volumes were provisioned in the Capacity Pool of different Service Level type. This issue
  has been fixed but for an ANF backend, where there are no Capacity Pools corresponding to a Service Level, the backend might get into a failed state. To correct this, fix the
  `serviceLevel` in the ANF backend file or add a Capacity Pool that matches the backend's `serviceLevel`, and then run the backend update operation.

**Fixes:**

- Updated the "Preparing the worker node" section of documentation to use default `find_multipaths` value for iSCSI multipathing.
- Fixed the issue of not waiting for the multipath device to appear when discovered device count is 1 (Issue [#511](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/511)).
- Fixed ANF issue with backend creation even when there are no valid Capacity Pool corresponding to a Service Level.

- **Kubernetes:** Updated to csi-snapshotter v4.0.0 for Kubernetes 1.20+.
- Added ability to restrict volume provisioning to a subset of Capacity Pools using `capacityPools` field in the ANF backends.
- ONTAP-SAN, ONTAP-NAS, and ONTAP-NAS-Flexgroup drivers now regard the `snapshotReserve` percentage as a percentage of the whole FlexVol size for new volumes (Issues [#554](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/554)
  , [#496](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/496)).
- ONTAP-SAN adds extra 10% to FlexVol size to account for LUN metadata (Issue [#555](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/555)).

- Fixed issue where ontap-san-economy snapshots could not be restored or deleted with storage prefix (Issue [#461](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/461)).
- **Kubernetes:** Trident in CSI mode now uses a unique igroup for each ONTAP SAN backend (Issue [437](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/437)).
- **Kubernetes:** Increased speed of node pod registrations.

**Enhancements:**

- Added support for shared VPC host projects to the GCP CVS driver (Issue [#529](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/529)).

- Added PVC annotation `trident.netapp.io/blockSize` to specify block/sector size for SolidFire backends (Issues [#33](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/33)
  and [#37](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/37)).
- Added PVC annotation `trident.netapp.io/fileSystem` to specify the file system type for iSCSI volumes (Issue [#37](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/37)).

## v17.04.0

**Fixes:**

- Trident now rejects ONTAP backends with no aggregates assigned to the SVM.
- Trident now allows ONTAP backends even if it cannot read the aggregate media type, or if the media type is unknown. However, such backends will be ignored for storage classes that require a specific media type.
- Trident launcher supports creating the ConfigMap in a non-default namespace.

**Enhancements:**

- The improved Trident launcher has a better support for failure recovery, error reporting, user arguments, and unit testing.
- Enabled SVM-scoped users for ONTAP backends.
- Switched to using vserver-show-aggr-get-iter API for ONTAP 9.0 and later to get aggregate media type.
- Added support for E-Series.
- Upgraded the etcd version to v3.1.3.
- Added release notes (CHANGELOG.md).

## v1.0

- Trident v1.0 provides storage orchestration for Kubernetes, acting as an external provisioner for NetApp ONTAP and SolidFire systems.
- Through its REST interface, Trident can provide storage orchestration for non-Kubernetes deployments.
